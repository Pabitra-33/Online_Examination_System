# Online_Examination_System

Online Examination System(OES) was developed by using Java Swing and Java AWT combines the robustness of Java programming with the user-friendly GUI components of Swing and AWT to create a seamless and efficient platform for conducting exams online.
Below are the key functionalities outlining the development of such a system:

1. User Interface Design:-
    - Java Swing and AWT are used to design the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application.
    - This includes creating screens for user registration, login, exam instructions, exam interface, result display, and administrative functionalities.
    
2. Exam Management:-
    - The system allows administrators to create, manage, and schedule exams.
    - This involves functionalities such as adding questions, setting time limits, assigning exam durations, and specifying passing criteria.
      
3. Accessibility Features:-
    - The system is developed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that users can bookmark the difficult question and can navigate with them later also.
    - This includes providing keyboard shortcuts, screen reader compatibility, and adjustable font sizes.
      
4. Scoring and Grading:
   - Automatically grade objective type questions based on predefined correct answers.
   - Calculate and display overall exam scores and provide feedback to students.
     
5. Result Generation:
   - Generate detailed results for each student after completing an exam.
     
6. Error Handling and Validation:
   - Perform input validation to prevent errors and ensure data integrity.
   - Handle exceptions gracefully to provide a smooth user experience.
     
- By incorporating these functionalities and best practices, the online examination system developed using Java Swing and AWT can provide a robust platform for conducting and managing exams securely and efficiently.
